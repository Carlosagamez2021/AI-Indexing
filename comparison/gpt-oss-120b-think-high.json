    "thinking": "We need to generate a repo map for this file: /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts. The code contains a class Calculator extending EventEmitter. We need to extract symbols according to priority: class, interface, function, method, property, variable, enum, decorator, namespace, type, event, parameter. We'll focus on class definitions, methods, properties, etc.\n\nThe repo map must be within 800 characters, only show method signatures, not implementation details, skip trivial getters/setters unless they have business logic? The rules say \"skip trivial getters/setters unless they have business logic\". Here getCurrentResult simply returns a field, clearHistory has logic, getHistory is a getter of history (though returns copy). But getCurrentResult is trivial but possibly used to get result; I think we can still include but it's trivial. However rule says skip trivial getters/setters unless they have business logic. getCurrentResult is trivial; I think we should skip? But maybe we can include as method signature because it's part of API. Could include but maybe we can skip to follow rule. However getStats, reset, clearHistory have logic. So include those.\n\nClass properties: history, maxHistorySize, currentResult. Methods: constructor, add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, getCurrentResult (maybe include), getHistory, clearHistory, getHistoryCount, validateOperands (private), addToHistory (private), reset, getStats. Private methods might still be included as they are part of class internal logic. We should also include events emitted: \"initialized\", \"calculation\", \"error\", \"clearHistory\", \"reset\". The priority includes \"event\" type: event handlers, but here there are events (emit). Might not list.\n\nWe must produce JSON with fields: content (repo map), description, keywords.\n\nWe need to follow formatting: For each file, we start with @@ path, then ⋮... description line(s) and │ lines for snippet signatures.\n\nE.g.:\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // Class definition\n│ class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Constructor\n│ constructor(maxHistory?: number);\n...\n\nBut we cannot include implementations (function bodies). So we must only show signatures.\n\nWe must omit jsdoc/comments. Use the code signature lines only.\n\nWe need to ensure content under 800 characters. Should be concise.\n\nWe need to include methods signatures: signature like add(a: number, b: number): number;\n\nBut we need to format as snippet lines with maybe class context? Usually they show just method signatures with class name context? The spec says \"remove all existing jsdocs or comment\". So signature lines can be as they appear inside class, but may need to be independent. Since it's within class file, we can show signatures without bodies but we need to indicate they are part of class, perhaps include class definition line once and then method signatures with indentation.\n\nBetter to do:\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // Calculator class extends EventEmitter\n│ export class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Properties\n│ private history: Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\n│ private readonly maxHistorySize: number;\n│ private currentResult: number;\n⋮... // Constructor\n│ constructor(maxHistory?: number);\n⋮... // Arithmetic methods\n│ add(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ subtract(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ multiply(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ divide(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ power(base: number, exponent: number): number;\n│ sqrt(value: number): number;\n⋮... // Accessor methods\n│ getCurrentResult(): number;\n│ getHistory(): Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\n│ getHistoryCount(): number;\n⋮... // Management methods\n│ clearHistory(): void;\n│ reset(): void;\n│ getStats(): { totalCalculations: number; operationsCount: Record<string, number>; lastCalculation?: Date; currentResult: number };\n⋮... // Private helpers\n│ private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void;\n│ private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void;\n│ }\n\nBut we need to ensure we close class braces. We can add closing brace.\n\nNeed to not exceed 800 characters. Let's count roughly. Each line about 70 chars maybe. Let's craft succinct.\n\nWill we need to list that the class extends? Yes.\n\nThe repo map content must be one string with line breaks. The description is a brief paragraph about what the code does: Implements calculator with arithmetic operations, event emitting, history tracking.\n\nKeywords: calculator, arithmetic, event emitter, history, typescript.\n\nNow ensure the JSON format.\n\nProceed to compress and ensure under 800 characters.\n\nNow compile content.\n\nFirst line: @@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n\nThen each block.\n\nMake sure to include proper separators.\n\nMake sure to not include trailing spaces.\n\nLet's construct:\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // Calculator class extending EventEmitter\n│ export class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Private fields\n│ private history: Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\n│ private readonly maxHistorySize: number;\n│ private currentResult: number;\n⋮... // Constructor\n│ constructor(maxHistory?: number);\n⋮... // Arithmetic operations\n│ add(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ subtract(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ multiply(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ divide(a: number, b: number): number;\n│ power(base: number, exponent: number): number;\n│ sqrt(value: number): number;\n⋮... // Result & history accessors\n│ getCurrentResult(): number;\n│ getHistory(): Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\n│ getHistoryCount(): number;\n⋮... // Management methods\n│ clearHistory(): void;\n│ reset(): void;\n│ getStats(): { totalCalculations: number; operationsCount: Record<string, number>; lastCalculation?: Date; currentResult: number };\n⋮... // Private helpers\n│ private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void;\n│ private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void;\n│ }\n\nNow count characters— let's roughly count:\n\nLine lengths including newline. I'll approximate:\n\n- \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" => ~33 + newline = 34\n- \"⋮... // Calculator class extending EventEmitter\" => ~42 + newline = 43\n- \"│ export class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\" => 46 + newline 47\n- \"⋮... // Private fields\" => 24 + newline 25\n- \"│ private history: Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\" => length: compute.\n\nLet's count: \"│ private history: Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\" length: starts after piped space. Actually including \"│ \"(2 chars) plus rest.\n\nRest:\n\n\"private history: Array<{ operation: string; operands: number[]; result: number; timestamp: Date }>;\"\n\nLet's count chars: \"private\"6+1=7; space? Actually \"private\" 7 inc space? Count manually:\n\nI'll just approximate ~100. Plus newline ~101.\n\nThe next lines similar.\n\nBut overall probably less than 800.\n\nNow compose JSON.\n\nRemember not to use markdown.\n\nProceed.\n\n"
