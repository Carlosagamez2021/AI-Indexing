    "thinking": "First, I need to create a repo map for the given file: /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts. The file is a TypeScript file, and I must follow the process and formatting rules.\n\nThe process is:\n1. Scan: Read through the code and identify all key symbols.\n2. Extract: Pull out classes, functions, interfaces, methods, properties, variables, etc., in the priority order.\n3. Format: Structure as repo map with @@ file path and │ symbol lines, with brief descriptions.\n4. Describe: Add brief descriptions after each ⋮... section.\n5. Output: Return JSON with content, description, and keywords.\n\nPriority order for extraction:\n1. class\n2. interface\n3. function\n4. method\n5. property\n6. variable\n7. enum\n8. decorator\n9. namespace\n10. type\n11. event\n12. parameter\n\nIn this file, I see:\n- A class `Calculator` that extends `EventEmitter`.\n- Properties: `history`, `maxHistorySize`, `currentResult`.\n- Methods: constructor, add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, getCurrentResult, getHistory, clearHistory, getHistoryCount, validateOperands (private), addToHistory (private), reset, getStats.\n\nI need to format this with:\n- @@ fullpath/filename.extension\n- ⋮... // Description\n- │    -\u003e Snippet based on requirement (remove all comments and JSDoc)\n\nKeep content under 800 characters. Only show method/function signatures, not implementation details. Skip trivial getters/setters unless they have business logic. Focus on public APIs and main functionality.\n\nLet me list out the key symbols in order:\n\n1. class Calculator extends EventEmitter\n2. properties: private history, private readonly maxHistorySize, private currentResult\n3. constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n4. methods: add(a: number, b: number): number, subtract(a: number, b: number): number, multiply(a: number, b: number): number, divide(a: number, b: number): number, power(base: number, exponent: number): number, sqrt(value: number): number, getCurrentResult(): number, getHistory(): Array\u003c{...}\u003e, clearHistory(): void, getHistoryCount(): number, private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void, private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void, reset(): void, getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\n\nI need to group related symbols together with single descriptions where appropriate.\n\nFormat the content with:\n- Start with @@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n- Then descriptions and snippets.\n\nEnsure the total content is under 800 characters. Let me estimate.\n\nFirst, the file path: @@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts – that's about 35 characters.\n\nThen, for each section, I'll add a description and the signature.\n\nI should group the arithmetic methods together since they are similar.\n\nAlso, note that some methods are private, but I need to include them as per the priority, but perhaps group them under a private methods section.\n\nThe rules say to extract in sequence, but also to group related symbols. So I'll list the class first, then properties, then methods.\n\nDescriptions should be brief.\n\nRemove all comments and JSDoc from the snippets.\n\nFinally, output in JSON with content, description, and keywords.\n\nDescription: One paragraph description of what the code does.\n\nKeywords: Minimal 3 words, max 5 keywords, separated by commas.\n\nNow, let's structure the repo map content.\n\nStart with the file header and imports, but the import is just `import { EventEmitter } from 'events'`, which I should include in the file header description.\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // File imports and class definition extending EventEmitter\n│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Calculator class with arithmetic operations and history tracking\n│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\n⋮... // Array to store calculation history\n│    private readonly maxHistorySize: number = 100\n⋮... // Maximum number of calculations in history\n│    private currentResult: number = 0\n⋮... // Current calculation result\n│    constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n⋮... // Initialize calculator with optional max history size\n│    add(a: number, b: number): number\n⋮... // Add two numbers and store in history\n│    subtract(a: number, b: number): number\n⋮... // Subtract two numbers and store in history\n│    multiply(a: number, b: number): number\n⋮... // Multiply two numbers and store in history\n│    divide(a: number, b: number): number\n⋮... // Divide two numbers with zero check\n│    power(base: number, exponent: number): number\n⋮... // Calculate power of a number\n│    sqrt(value: number): number\n⋮... // Calculate square root with negative check\n│    getCurrentResult(): number\n⋮... // Get the current result\n│    getHistory(): Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e\n⋮... // Get a copy of calculation history\n│    clearHistory(): void\n⋮... // Clear all history and reset current result\n│    getHistoryCount(): number\n⋮... // Get the number of calculations in history\n│    private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\n⋮... // Validate that operands are valid numbers\n│    private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\n⋮... // Add calculation to history and manage size\n│    reset(): void\n⋮... // Reset calculator to initial state\n│    getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\n⋮... // Get statistics about calculations\n│}\n\nI need to make sure the content is under 800 characters. Let me count the characters of this.\n\nFirst, the file path line: @@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts – let's say 35 chars.\n\nEach description line with ⋮... is about, say, 10-20 chars plus the description text. I need to keep descriptions brief.\n\nActually, I should write the content as a single string with newlines.\n\nLet me draft the content string.\n\n\"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n⋮... // File imports and class definition extending EventEmitter\\n│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\\n⋮... // Calculator class with arithmetic operations and history tracking\\n│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\\n⋮... // Array to store calculation history\\n│    private readonly maxHistorySize: number = 100\\n⋮... // Maximum number of calculations in history\\n│    private currentResult: number = 0\\n⋮... // Current calculation result\\n│    constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\\n⋮... // Initialize calculator with optional max history size\\n│    add(a: number, b: number): number\\n⋮... // Add two numbers and store in history\\n│    subtract(a: number, b: number): number\\n⋮... // Subtract two numbers and store in history\\n│    multiply(a: number, b: number): number\\n⋮... // Multiply two numbers and store in history\\n│    divide(a: number, b: number): number\\n⋮... // Divide two numbers with zero check\\n│    power(base: number, exponent: number): number\\n⋮... // Calculate power of a number\\n│    sqrt(value: number): number\\n⋮... // Calculate square root with negative check\\n│    getCurrentResult(): number\\n⋮... // Get the current result\\n│    getHistory(): Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e\\n⋮... // Get a copy of calculation history\\n│    clearHistory(): void\\n⋮... // Clear all history and reset current result\\n│    getHistoryCount(): number\\n⋮... // Get the number of calculations in history\\n│    private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\\n⋮... // Validate that operands are valid numbers\\n│    private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\\n⋮... // Add calculation to history and manage size\\n│    reset(): void\\n⋮... // Reset calculator to initial state\\n│    getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\\n⋮... // Get statistics about calculations\\n│}\"\n\nNow, count the characters. This is a long string. I need to ensure it's under 800 characters.\n\nLet me approximate: each line has about 50-100 characters, and there are many lines. I might need to condense or group more.\n\nPerhaps group the arithmetic methods into one description to save space.\n\nFor example, instead of listing each arithmetic method separately, group them.\n\nAlso, the properties can be grouped.\n\nRevised approach:\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // File imports and Calculator class extending EventEmitter\n│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Private properties for history, max size, and current result\n│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\n│    private readonly maxHistorySize: number = 100\n│    private currentResult: number = 0\n⋮... // Constructor with optional max history parameter\n│    constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n⋮... // Arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt\n│    add(a: number, b: number): number\n│    subtract(a: number, b: number): number\n│    multiply(a: number, b: number): number\n│    divide(a: number, b: number): number\n│    power(base: number, exponent: number): number\n│    sqrt(value: number): number\n⋮... // Methods to get current result, history, clear history, and get count\n│    getCurrentResult(): number\n│    getHistory(): Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e\n│    clearHistory(): void\n│    getHistoryCount(): number\n⋮... // Private methods for validation and adding to history\n│    private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\n│    private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\n⋮... // Additional methods: reset and get stats\n│    reset(): void\n│    getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\n│}\n\nThis should be shorter. Let me count the characters.\n\nWrite it out:\n\n\"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n⋮... // File imports and Calculator class extending EventEmitter\\n│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\\n⋮... // Private properties for history, max size, and current result\\n│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\\n│    private readonly maxHistorySize: number = 100\\n│    private currentResult: number = 0\\n⋮... // Constructor with optional max history parameter\\n│    constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\\n⋮... // Arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt\\n│    add(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    subtract(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    multiply(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    divide(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    power(base: number, exponent: number): number\\n│    sqrt(value: number): number\\n⋮... // Methods to get current result, history, clear history, and get count\\n│    getCurrentResult(): number\\n│    getHistory(): Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e\\n│    clearHistory(): void\\n│    getHistoryCount(): number\\n⋮... // Private methods for validation and adding to history\\n│    private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\\n│    private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\\n⋮... // Additional methods: reset and get stats\\n│    reset(): void\\n│    getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\\n│}\"\n\nNow, estimate character count. The string is long, but I think it's around 600-700 characters. I need to be precise.\n\nLet me count:\n\n- \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" : 31 characters (including @@ and space)\n\nActually, path is \"/Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\", so with \"@@ \", it's 3 + 28 = 31 characters.\n\nThen newline: \\n is 1 character.\n\nEach line with ⋮... and description: e.g., \"⋮... // File imports and Calculator class extending EventEmitter\" – let's count: \"⋮... // \" is 7 characters, plus description. \"File imports and Calculator class extending EventEmitter\" – that's about 50 characters? Total ~57.\n\nBetter to count the entire string.\n\nI can write a simplified version to save space.\n\nSince the class has many methods, I can group the arithmetic methods under one description.\n\nAlso, the getStats method has a complex return type, but I need to include the signature.\n\nTo save characters, I might abbreviate the array type in history, but I should keep it as is for clarity.\n\nThe rules say to remove all comments and JSDoc, so in the snippets, I only have the signatures without comments.\n\nIn the content, the descriptions are in the ⋮... lines, not in the │ lines.\n\nIn the │ lines, I should only have the code snippets without any comments.\n\nFor example, for history property: \"│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\" – no comment.\n\nSimilarly for methods.\n\nNow, for the description in the response: \"One paragraph description\" of what the code does.\n\nThe code is a Calculator class that performs arithmetic operations, tracks history, and emits events.\n\nKeywords: e.g., \"calculator, arithmetic, history, events, typescript\"\n\nMinimal 3 words, max 5 keywords.\n\nNow, let's finalize the content string.\n\nI need to ensure under 800 characters. Let me write a compact version.\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // File with import and class definition\n│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Properties for history tracking\n│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\n│    private readonly maxHistorySize: number = 100\n│    private currentResult: number = 0\n⋮... // Constructor\n│    constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n⋮... // Arithmetic methods\n│    add(a: number, b: number): number\n│    subtract(a: number, b: number): number\n│    multiply(a: number, b: number): number\n│    divide(a: number, b: number): number\n│    power(base: number, exponent: number): number\n│    sqrt(value: number): number\n⋮... // History management methods\n│    getCurrentResult(): number\n│    getHistory(): Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e\n│    clearHistory(): void\n│    getHistoryCount(): number\n⋮... // Private validation and history methods\n│    private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\n│    private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\n⋮... // Reset and stats methods\n│    reset(): void\n│    getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\n│}\n\nNow, count the characters.\n\nFirst line: \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" – let's calculate: \"/Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" has 28 characters, plus \"@@ \" is 3, total 31 characters for that line, but with newline, 32.\n\nIn the string, it's \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n\" – that's 31 chars for the text plus \\n, so 32.\n\nThen \"⋮... // File with import and class definition\\n\" – \"⋮... // \" is 7 chars, \"File with import and class definition\" is 32 chars, total 39, plus \\n, 40.\n\n\"│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\\n\" – \"│\" is 1, \"class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\" is 35 chars, total 36, plus \\n, 37.\n\nAnd so on. This might be over. I need to actually count.\n\nPerhaps I can shorten the descriptions or omit some details.\n\nAnother idea: since the history array type is repeated, I can define it once, but the format doesn't allow that; I have to show it where it is.\n\nI think for the purpose, I can keep it as is and hope it's under 800.\n\nLet me try to write the string and count.\n\nS = \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n\"  // 31 chars for text, 1 for \\n, total 32\n\n+ \"⋮... // File with import and class definition\\n\"  // \"⋮... // \" = 7, description = 32, \\n =1, total 40\n\n+ \"│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\\n\"  // \"│\" =1, text=35, \\n=1, total 37\n\n+ \"⋮... // Properties for history tracking\\n\"  // \"⋮... // \"=7, desc=26, \\n=1, total 34\n\n+ \"│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\\n\"  // let's count: \"│    \" =5, \"private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\" – operation: string (14), operands: number[] (16), result: number (13), timestamp: Date (15), plus Array\u003c{ and }\u003e = [] etc. Approximately 80 characters? Plus \\n, say 81.\n\nBetter to estimate: the string inside is long. \"private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\" – count: p-r-i-v-a-t-e- -h-i-s-t-o-r-y-:- -A-r-r-a-y-\u003c-{- -o-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n-:- -s-t-r-i-n-g-, -o-p-e-r-a-n-d-s-:- -n-u-m-b-e-r-[-, -r-e-s-u-l-t-:- -n-u-m-b-e-r-, -t-i-m-e-s-t-a-m-p-:- -D-a-t-e- -}-\u003e -=- -[] \n\nLet's count: \"private history: \" is 15, \"Array\u003c{ \" is 7, \"operation: string, \" is 16, \"operands: number[], \" is 18, \"result: number, \" is 14, \"timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\" is 20, total 15+7+16+18+14+20 = 90 characters? Plus \"│    \" which is 4 spaces and │, so 5 characters, total 95, plus \\n, 96.\n\nSimilarly for other lines.\n\nThis is getting too long. I need to abbreviate.\n\nPerhaps for the history type, I can shorten it to something like \"Array\u003cCalculationEntry\u003e\" but in the code, it's inline, so I have to keep it as is for the repo map, but the repo map should show the actual code, so I think I have to include it.\n\nMaybe I can omit the private methods or group them more.\n\nThe rules say to extract all key symbols, so I should include them.\n\nPerhaps the content is fine, and I'll just ensure the total is under 800 by making descriptions shorter.\n\nLet's try with very brief descriptions.\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // Import and class\n│class Calculator extends EventEmitter {\n⋮... // Properties\n│    private history: Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e = []\n│    private readonly maxHistorySize: number = 100\n│    private currentResult: number = 0\n⋮... // Constructor\n│    constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n⋮... // Math methods\n│    add(a: number, b: number): number\n│    subtract(a: number, b: number): number\n│    multiply(a: number, b: number): number\n│    divide(a: number, b: number): number\n│    power(base: number, exponent: number): number\n│    sqrt(value: number): number\n⋮... // Getter methods\n│    getCurrentResult(): number\n│    getHistory(): Array\u003c{ operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date }\u003e\n│    clearHistory(): void\n│    getHistoryCount(): number\n⋮... // Private helpers\n│    private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\n│    private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\n⋮... // Other methods\n│    reset(): void\n│    getStats(): { totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number }\n│}\n\nNow, count the string length.\n\nI can use a character counter, but since I'm AI, I can estimate.\n\nThe longest lines are the history array type, which is about 90 characters each time it appears, and it appears twice in the snippets.\n\nIn the content, it appears in the property and in the getHistory return type.\n\nTo save space, I could note the type once, but the format requires showing it where it is.\n\nPerhaps for the repo map, I can have a type definition, but the file doesn't have a separate type; it's inline.\n\nI think I have to proceed with this.\n\nLet's assume the content is within limits for now.\n\nFor the description: \"A Calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, square root) with history tracking and event emission.
