    "thinking": "The user provided instructions: \"## Context System wants you to give repo map for this file, File path: /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\". The file content is shown. We must produce the repo map JSON per the requirements.\n\nWe have to list all key symbols in that file. Priority order: class, interface, function, method, property, variable, enum, decorator, namespace, type, event, parameter.\n\nThe file defines a class Calculator which extends EventEmitter. It has private properties: history, maxHistorySize, currentResult. Constructor. Methods: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, getCurrentResult, getHistory, clearHistory, getHistoryCount, validateOperands (private), addToHistory (private), reset, getStats. We need to present method signatures, not implementation, removing comments. Only public methods? The spec says: focus on public APIs and main functionality, skip trivial getters/setters unless business logic, which we have some getters (getCurrentResult, getHistory, getHistoryCount, getStats) that provide business logic, so include them.\n\nAlso event names: \"initialized\", \"calculation\", \"error\", \"clearHistory\", \"reset\" are emitted via `this.emit`. They represent events; should we include them? They are not defined as event handlers, but code uses them. They may be considered events; but the instructions for repo map say we can include \"event\" class for EventEmitter? It says event - Event handlers. But the file doesn't define event handlers; just emits. But we could list event names as symbol. However, the guidelines may want us to focus on symbols defined in file (classes, etc). So we might skip event names.\n\nWe need to follow formatting: the output is a valid JSON object with keys: \"content\", \"description\", \"keywords\".\n\n\"content\" should be repo map lines: It will include lines for file path with @@, and then with the structure: \"⋮... // Description\" and each method signature lines preceded by \"|   ->\".\n\nNeed to produce at most 800 characters due to constraint? They said keep content under 800 characters for optimal semantic search. But we might surpass if we include many methods. Let's count.\n\nNumber of symbols: class, methods: 12 (?) including private methods, plus private properties.\n\nBut we may need to include only publicly accessible ones? The instructions: \"Focus on public APIs and main functionality.\" So probably only include public methods, maybe including private ones? It says group related symbols together with single descriptions. We could skip private properties, the private methods as they are internal? But maybe include them as private? But \"property\" includes class properties.\n\nOk, let's read the repo map format requirement:\n\n## Format:\n### Structure\n@@ fullpath/filename.extension\n⋮... // Description\n│    -> Snippet based on requirement\n│    -> Remove all existing jsdocs or comment\n⋮... // Description\n│    -> More snippet if exists\n⋮... // Description\n│    -> Repeat\n\nThat indicates for each symbol we produce one snippet maybe; we can group multiple methods under '⋮... // Description'.\n\nThe 'content' string will presumably contain all these lines.\n\nThe snippet based on requirement: we need the method signature with parameters and return type but no implementation.\n\nAlso remove comments.\n\nOk.\n\nAlso note they said \"Skip trivial getters/setters unless they have business logic\". Our getters have logic, so include.\n\nAlso \"Remove all comments and JSDoc from original code\" - but we are not including implementation anyway, so nothing.\n\nAlso \"Group related symbols together with single descriptions\" - maybe group all methods under a single description, e.g., \"Arithmetic Operations\".\n\nBut we can create one description block per group maybe.\n\nNeed to consider the order: priority: class, interface, function, method, property, variable, etc.\n\nThus first produce a block describing the Calculator class, then a block for its public methods and maybe property \"history\" etc.\n\nLet's design the content.\n\nThe file path: /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n\nWe write:\n\n@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\n⋮... // Calculator class extending EventEmitter\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\n\nThen a description for properties:\n\n⋮... // Private state properties and constructor\n│    -> private history: Array<{operation:string, operands:number[], result:number, timestamp:Date}> = []\n│    -> private readonly maxHistorySize: number\n│    -> private currentResult: number = 0\n│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n\nBut the constructor has a body; we only include the signature: \"constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\"\n\nNext, public methods:\n\n⋮... // Arithmetic operations\n│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number\n│    -> subtract(a: number, b: number): number\n│    -> multiply(a: number, b: number): number\n│    -> divide(a: number, b: number): number\n│    -> power(base: number, exponent: number): number\n│    -> sqrt(value: number): number\n\nThen getters & others:\n\n⋮... // Result and history accessors\n│    -> getCurrentResult(): number\n│    -> getHistory(): Array<{operation:string, operands:number[], result:number, timestamp:Date}>\n│    -> getHistoryCount(): number\n│    -> getStats(): {totalCalculations:number, operationsCount:Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?:Date, currentResult:number}\n\nThen internal methods:\n\n⋮... // Internal validation and history handling (private)\n│    -> private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\n│    -> private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\n\nAlso reset and clearHistory:\n\nMaybe group them: \"State management operations\"\n\nBut we already had history ones. We can add:\n\n⋮... // State management\n│    -> clearHistory(): void\n│    -> reset(): void\n\nWait, clearHistory has signature \"clearHistory(): void\" which includes event. reset: \"reset(): void\"\n\nNow we also have constructor event emission, but that's inside body.\n\nNow, we should capture that the constructor sets maxHistorySize and emits \"initialized\". But we might not include that.\n\nWe might also choose to skip private methods but include them under a description like \"Internal\".\n\nNow, do we need to display property initialisations? They have initial values; we can mention them.\n\nRemember to keep content under 800 characters. Let's approximate. Each line: about 30-60 chars. Let's compute.\n\nNumber of lines:\n\n1. @@ path\n2-3: first description and class signature\n4-7: description for private state and constructor signature\n8-15: arithmetic operations \n(8 for description, 6 lines)\n16-20: result & history accessors\n(16 description, 4 lines)\n21-23: state management\n(21 description, 2 lines)\n24-26: internal validation & history handling (private)\n(24 description, 2 lines)\n\nThat's 26 lines.\n\nLet's approximate characters: each signature about 50, plus lines, but total may be ~1500 char maybe? Actually 26*60=1560. Too high.\n\nBut we can shorten by merging description lines, reduce number of method lines etc. They want a succinct repo map; maybe we can show groups of methods with a single line each? The format says \"-> Snippet based on requirement\" could be just method signature alone; we can combine lines for similar groups perhaps.\n\nWe can compress like:\n\n```\n⋮... // Calculator class\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\n│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\n│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number\n│    -> subtract(a: number, b: number): number\n...\n```\n\nBut per the required formatting maybe we need each method on own line.\n\nThe 800 character limit maybe not strict; but they said keep content under 800 characters for optimal semantic search; we can keep it under 800.\n\nLet's try to craft a concise map.\n\nWe could list only class, constructor, public APIs group, internal group.\n\nLet's estimate again: 1: @@ line (30). Next description with class and maybe first method: \"export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\" (50). Next, \"constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\" (30). Then we can list all public method signatures separated by commas or new lines? Might be okay. Each method about 30, say we have 12 methods, that's 360. So far 30+50+30+360=470. Then include private methods maybe 30. So 500. Acceptable.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nBut we must maintain correct JSON with valid escaping etc.\n\nAlso the 'description' field: \"One paragraph description\" summary of the code. Provide a brief summary: \"The `Calculator` class extends Node's EventEmitter to provide arithmetic operations, result history, and statistics, emitting events on each calculation and error.\" etc.\n\nKeywords: maybe \"calculator, arithmetic operations, event emitter\"\n\nNow produce final JSON.\n\nBut we must format content variable as string. Inside JSON string, we must escape newline characters. But typical output from system might treat triple-quoted string? Usually we produce as raw string with newline escapes \\n. In JSON, we need to escape backslashes and quotes.\n\nWe have to return the JSON object exactly.\n\nThe content will contain newlines and maybe spaces. In JSON string, we include \\n for newlines. But the guidelines didn't specify formatting of JSON's content string. It's typical to use raw formatting string with \\n. The example didn't show. We should produce a string with newline characters. So let's do:\n\n\"content\": \"...\\n...\"\n\nBut inside JSON, we need double quotes around string and escape the double quotes and backslashes accordingly. We'll produce:\n\n{\n  \"content\": \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n⋮... // Calculator class\\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\\n│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\\n⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\\n│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> subtract(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> multiply(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> divide(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> power(base: number, exponent: number): number\\n│    -> sqrt(value: number): number\\n⋮... // Result and history accessors\\n│    -> getCurrentResult(): number\\n│    -> getHistory(): Array<{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}>\\n│    -> getHistoryCount(): number\\n│    -> getStats(): {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}\\n⋮... // State management\\n│    -> clearHistory(): void\\n│    -> reset(): void\\n⋮... // Internal validation & history handling (private)\\n│    -> private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\\n│    -> private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\",\n  \"description\": \"...\",\n  \"keywords\": \"...\"\n}\n\nBut we must escape backslashes? Not many.\n\nBetter to use a raw multiline string with newline escapes. For readability we may embed \\n. Let's produce.\n\nAlso each of the array definitions contains '{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}'. This contains curly braces. In JSON string, curly braces are fine, but we must escape double quotes inside the signature. There's no double quotes inside the string except maybe. The signatures use double quotes? No. So not need to escape. But we need to escape newline as \\n.\n\nAlso our representation uses double quotes around the object keys and values? No, we don't include quotes; we use the TypeScript syntax. So no double quotes inside.\n\nBut it contains backticks? No.\n\nOk.\n\nCheck the snippet lines: we need to be careful about the arrow \"->\" and other characters may not need escaping.\n\nNow we craft description: \"The `Calculator` class extends Node's EventEmitter to provide arithmetic operations with history tracking. It supports add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, and exposes methods for accessing current result, history, stats, and resetting state. Events are emitted on initialization, each calculation, errors, history clearing, and reset.\"\n\nKeywords: \"calculator,timestamp,math,history,event\"\n\nNow put everything in JSON.\n\nBut we must ensure the JSON string remains valid.\n\nLet's construct content string:\n\n\"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n⋮... // Calculator class\\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\\n│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\\n⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\\n│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> subtract(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> multiply(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> divide(a: number, b: number): number\\n│    -> power(base: number, exponent: number): number\\n│    -> sqrt(value: number): number\\n⋮... // Result and history accessors\\n│    -> getCurrentResult(): number\\n│    -> getHistory(): Array<{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}>\\n│    -> getHistoryCount(): number\\n│    -> getStats(): {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}\\n⋮... // State management\\n│    -> clearHistory(): void\\n│    -> reset(): void\\n⋮... // Internal validation & history handling (private)\\n│    -> private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void\\n│    -> private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\"\n\nBut there are backticks? No.\n\nNow we need to check that the curly braces within Array<...> and object type are not confusing JSON. In JSON string, curly braces are fine.\n\nWait: our string uses backticks? No. So we can keep.\n\nNeed to escape newline properly: \\n. Yes.\n\nAlso escape the backslashes if we had any. We have no backslashes.\n\nDouble quotes inside string: we use double quotes for JSON key \"content\". The string uses no double quotes inside, only single quotes? Actually inside the string we didn't use any double quotes. There is no double quote except the ones at the start and end of JSON key. So no escaping needed.\n\nBut we might inadvertently have double quotes inside type definitions? We wrote \"operation: string\" etc. There is no double quote inside, just colon. So it's fine.\n\nNow produce final JSON object.\n\nNote: We need to ensure no trailing spaces. Provide keys and values.\n\nAlso we need to include quotes around \"content\" string.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's craft final output.\n\nCheck char length: The content string length? Let's approximate: Each line about 70 characters. We have maybe 24 lines each about 70 = 1680, maybe > 800. Let's compute more accurately.\n\nThe content string includes many characters, but we can reduce by merging method signatures in a single line or grouping them with semicolons? But spec says use \"->\" each line.\n\nBut to keep under 800 characters, we can remove the \"private\" methods maybe. Let's see.\n\nIf we exclude private methods, we cut 2 lines. So about 1400 - > 800 still >.\n\nWe can condense by using 'public' group with comma-separated? But the format demands each signature on new line. Not strongly defined. The guidelines: \"only show method/function signatures, not implementation details\". It doesn't say we must separate each with line. But the formatting example uses each method on own line with arrow. So we will do that.\n\nBut maybe we can reduce text by using short names? but we can't change file.\n\nWe can try to shrink lines: reduce space at start of each line? Not significant.\n\nThe bigger factor is many lines. But maybe 800 char limit is for content per file; we may have 26 lines ~ maybe 1300 char but okay if we reduce.\n\nLet's compute more exactly: Counting each character.\n\nLine 1: \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" length: 34? Count: 2 (@@) + space + path. Path length? Let's count: \"/Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" length: 32? Wait - let's approximate: \"/Volumes/\" = 9, \"Indexing/\" = 9, \"Calculator.ts\" = 12, plus slash? The string is \"/Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\" => 9+9+12 = 30. So line length 34 incl two characters. So around 34.\n\nLine 2: \"⋮... // Calculator class\" length: 23? Actually \"⋮... // Calculator class\" includes bullet. Let's approximate 25.\n\nLine 3: \"│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\" let's count: \"│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\". Length: 1 (│) + 4 spaces + -> + space + \"export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\". That's 1+4+2+... Let's approximate 54.\n\nLine 4: \"│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\" length maybe 43.\n\nLine 5: \"⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\" length ~35.\n\nLine 6: \"│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number\" length ~42.\n\nLine 7: subtract; same ~42.\n\nLine 8: multiply; ~45.\n\nLine 9: divide; ~42.\n\nLine 10: power; ~47.\n\nLine 11: sqrt; ~38.\n\nLine 12: \"⋮... // Result and history accessors\" length ~35.\n\nLine 13: getCurrentResult; ~36.\n\nLine 14: getHistory signature: length maybe 88? let's count: \"│    -> getHistory(): Array<{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}>\". This is long. Let's approximate 100.\n\nLine 15: getHistoryCount: 38.\n\nLine 16: getStats: signature big: \"│    -> getStats(): {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}\". This could be ~140.\n\nLine 17: \"⋮... // State management\" length ~30.\n\nLine 18: clearHistory: 34.\n\nLine 19: reset: 13? Actually \"│    -> reset(): void\" length ~28.\n\nLine 20: \"⋮... // Internal validation & history handling (private)\" length ~60.\n\nLine 21: private validateOperands: length about 54.\n\nLine 22: private addToHistory: length ~60.\n\nTotal characters ~1,200 maybe. So over 800.\n\nWe could reduce content by excluding some method lines, e.g., exclude private methods, and maybe condense array type signatures by using ellipsis placeholders: \"Array<...>\"? But must be method signatures. Perhaps we can shorten by removing generic types from signatures? But we need correct signature.\n\nBut maybe we can combine group descriptions and include method names separated by commas in one line. The format doesn't strictly require each method on a new line. The guidelines: \"Method signatures\" but can have multiple per line.\n\nLet's re-architect: Keep block for public methods, and list them within a single line separated by commas. But then we lose line per method but maybe acceptable.\n\nBut the formatting example used multiple lines. But we could compromise: group them as single line signature but we want each method signature; we can separate by commas but need semicolons. Maybe use \"│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number, subtract(a: number, b: number): number, multiply(a: number, b: number): number, divide(a: number, b: number): number, power(base: number, exponent: number): number, sqrt(value: number): number\". That compresses to one line.\n\nSimilarly for getters: \"│    -> getCurrentResult(): number, getHistory(): Array<...>, getHistoryCount(): number, getStats(): {...}\".\n\nThen we have fewer lines.\n\nHowever, is this acceptable? The guidelines: \"-> Snippet based on requirement; Remove all existing jsdocs or comment.\" It doesn't explicitly state each method signature must be separate line. So we can compress.\n\nAlso for private methods we could combine similarly.\n\nThis will reduce line count drastically and reduce characters.\n\nLet's recompute.\n\nLines:\n\n1 path\n2 description for class + signature\n3 maybe another? But we can combine constructor and class? Perhaps separate.\n\nLet's do:\n\nLine 1: @@ path\nLine 2: class description and signature\nLine 3: constructor signature\nLine 4: public arithmetic operations list\nLine 5: result & history accessors list\nLine 6: state management list\nLine 7: private methods list\n\nTotal 7 lines. Each maybe 80-120 char. So content length maybe ~500-700 char. Good.\n\nLet's build each:\n\nLine 2: \"⋮... // Calculator class\\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\"\n\nBut we might combine two lines: one for description and signature. We can produce two lines or join? The guidelines: group related symbols together with single descriptions. So we can have description line then the arrow lines maybe separate lines. We can keep one description line and following arrow lines. So for class, maybe have description and class signature line.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's craft:\n\nLine 1: \"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\"\n\nLine 2: \"⋮... // Calculator class\"\n\nLine 3: \"│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\"\n\nLine 4: \"│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\"\n\nLine 5: \"⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\"\n\nLine 6: \"│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number, subtract(a: number, b: number): number, multiply(a: number, b: number): number, divide(a: number, b: number): number, power(base: number, exponent: number): number, sqrt(value: number): number\"\n\nLine 7: \"⋮... // Result and history accessors\"\n\nLine 8: \"│    -> getCurrentResult(): number, getHistory(): Array<{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}>, getHistoryCount(): number, getStats(): {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}\"\n\nLine 9: \"⋮... // State management\"\n\nLine 10: \"│    -> clearHistory(): void, reset(): void\"\n\nLine 11: \"⋮... // Internal validation & history handling (private)\"\n\nLine 12: \"│    -> private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void, private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\"\n\nNow each line length maybe 80-120 characters. Count:\n\nLine 5: length: \"⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\" ~35.\n\nLine 6: long: Let's approximate:\n\n\"│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number, subtract(a: number, b: number): number, multiply(a: number, b: number): number, divide(a: number, b: number): number, power(base: number, exponent: number): number, sqrt(value: number): number\"\n\nCount: start \"│    -> \" = 7. Then add: \"add(a: number, b: number): number\" length 34 plus comma + space 2 = 6? Actually after each method, we have \", \". So 2 char. We'll approximate each method signature ~34 char. There are 6 methods => 6*34 = 204 plus 5*2 = 10 => ~214. Add 7 initial char = 221. So ~221 char.\n\nLine 8: Also long. We'll approximate ~250.\n\nLine 10: moderate.\n\nLine 12: moderate.\n\nSo total char: 34 + 35 + 7 + 200 ~ 600 maybe.\n\nGood.\n\nNow we need to generate JSON string with these lines separated by \\n.\n\nLet's prepare content string with \\n inserted appropriately.\n\nContent string (approx):\n\n\"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n⋮... // Calculator class\\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\\n│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\\n⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\\n│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number, subtract(a: number, b: number): number, multiply(a: number, b: number): number, divide(a: number, b: number): number, power(base: number, exponent: number): number, sqrt(value: number): number\\n⋮... // Result and history accessors\\n│    -> getCurrentResult(): number, getHistory(): Array<{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}>, getHistoryCount(): number, getStats(): {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}\\n⋮... // State management\\n│    -> clearHistory(): void, reset(): void\\n⋮... // Internal validation & history handling (private)\\n│    -> private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void, private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\"\n\nWe need to check for any double quotes in that string. The arrow lines have no double quotes. The Array<{operation: string, ...}> uses angle brackets and braces but no double quotes. That is fine.\n\nWe also have parentheses and braces. Nothing to escape.\n\nBut we need to escape the less-than and greater-than signs? Not in JSON string. They are fine. No special characters.\n\nHowever, we need to escape newline characters: but we already have \\n.\n\nNow, ensure that the backslashes in our string (like \\t?) Actually we don't have any backslashes. Good.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nThe description: \"The `Calculator` class extends Node’s EventEmitter to provide arithmetic operations, history tracking, and statistics. It exposes methods for add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, and getters for the current result, history, stats, plus state‑reset and history‑clear functions.

Keep under 200 chars.\n\nOk:\n\n\"description\": \"The Calculator class extends EventEmitter to provide arithmetic operations, history tracking, and stats, emitting events for each calculation and error. It offers APIs for add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, and accessors for result, history, and stats.\"\n\nNow \"keywords\": \"calculator, arithmetic, event emitter, history\"\n\nBetter: \"calculator, arithmetic, history, events\"\n\nLet's produce final JSON.\n\nCheck quoting: The JSON string values will need double quotes around them. The content string also uses double quotes inside string, but none. Good.\n\nBut we used curly braces inside content, but they are characters not requiring escaping. However, inside JSON string, curly braces are fine.\n\nCheck for any characters that need escaping: Double quotes, backslashes. We have none. Good.\n\nNow produce final output.\n\nMake sure that each \\n is represented as literal newline? In JSON, \\n should be escaped. But we want actual newline? The content string will be the JSON string representation with newlines. We can either produce real newline characters inside the JSON string? In JSON, newlines inside string must be escaped? Actually according to JSON spec, line break characters inside string cannot appear unescaped. They must be escaped as \\n or \\r. So we should use \\n inside string. So we have to produce \\n representation.\n\nThus the content value: we should put the string with \\n escapes.\n\nWe'll produce:\n\n\"content\":\"@@ /Volumes/Indexing/Calculator.ts\\n⋮... // Calculator class\\n│    -> export class Calculator extends EventEmitter\\n│    -> constructor(maxHistory: number = 100)\\n⋮... // Public arithmetic operations\\n│    -> add(a: number, b: number): number, subtract(a: number, b: number): number, multiply(a: number, b: number): number, divide(a: number, b: number): number, power(base: number, exponent: number): number, sqrt(value: number): number\\n⋮... // Result and history accessors\\n│    -> getCurrentResult(): number, getHistory(): Array<{operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}>, getHistoryCount(): number, getStats(): {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}\\n⋮... // State management\\n│    -> clearHistory(): void, reset(): void\\n⋮... // Internal validation & history handling (private)\\n│    -> private validateOperands(...operands: number[]): void, private addToHistory(operation: string, operands: number[], result: number): void\"\n\nWait, inside array type we have \"<\" and \">\" which are fine. But curly braces inside: {operation: string, operands: number[], result: number, timestamp: Date}. This contains \">\" for date? Actually uses \"Date\" type, not closing >. That's fine.\n\nBut within getStats signature we have {totalCalculations: number, operationsCount: Record<string, number>, lastCalculation?: Date, currentResult: number}. That's fine.\n\nMake sure backtick or other special characters? No.\n\nOne more check: Our content string includes \"private\" as part of signature lines. That's fine.\n\nNow produce final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"content\": \"...\",\n  \"description\": \"...\",\n  \"keywords\": \"...\"\n}\n\nOk.\n\nEnsure there is no trailing commas. Also ensure proper escaping of backslashes: None.\n\nBut note we used \"private\" inside string: fine.\n\nNow produce final answer."
